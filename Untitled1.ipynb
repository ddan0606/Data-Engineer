    "A tree is a popular data structure that is non-linear in nature. Unlike other data structures like an array, stack, queue, and linked list which are linear in nature, a tree represents a hierarchical structure. The ordering information of a tree is not important. A tree contains nodes and 2 pointers. These two pointers are the left child and the right child of the parent node. Let us understand the terms of tree in detail.\n",
    "+ <b>Root</b>: The root of a tree is the topmost node of the tree that has no parent node. There is only one root node in every tree.\n",
    "+ <b>Parent Node</b>:  The node which is a predecessor of a node is called the parent node of that node.\n",
    "+ <b>Child Node</b>: The node which is the immediate successor of a node is called the child node of that node.\n",
    "+ <b>Sibling</b>: Children of the same parent node are called siblings.\n",
    "+ <b>Edge</b>: Edge acts as a link between the parent node and the child node.\n",
    "+ <b>Leaf</b>: A node that has no child is known as the leaf node. It is the last node of the tree. There can be multiple leaf nodes in a tree.\n",
    "+ <b>Subtree</b>: The subtree of a node is the tree considering that particular node as the root node.\n",
    "+ <b>Depth</b>: The depth of the node is the distance from the root node to that particular node.\n",
    "+ <b>Height</b>: The height of the node is the distance from that node to the deepest node of that subtree.\n",
    "+ <b>Height of tree</b>: The Height of the tree is the maximum height of any node. This is the same as the height of the root node.\n",
    "+ <b>Level</b>: A level is the number of parent nodes corresponding to a given node of the tree.\n",
    "+ <b>Degree of node</b>:  The degree of a node is the number of its children.\n",
    "+ <b>NULL</b>: The number of NULL nodes in a binary tree is (N+1), where N is the number of nodes in a binary tree."
